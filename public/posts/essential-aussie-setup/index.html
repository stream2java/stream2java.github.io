<p>Moving to Australia? Here are the three essential services you&rsquo;ll need to set up as soon as you arrive. Trust me, these will make your life so much easier from day one.</p>
<h3 id="-tax-file-number-tfn">🏛️ Tax File Number (TFN)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-tax-file-number-tfn">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Reality Check:</strong> Everyone says &ldquo;you can only apply after arriving in Australia,&rdquo; but here&rsquo;s the real deal—you can actually apply once you have your accommodation sorted.</p>
<p><strong>What You Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmed address in Australia</li>
<li>Valid visa documents</li>
<li>Form of identification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re physically in the country. As soon as you have a place to stay, get this application in. The sooner you apply, the sooner you can start earning without ridiculous tax deductions.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Usually 2-4 weeks, so the earlier the better.</p>
<h3 id="-banking-with-commonwealth-bank-cba">🏦 Banking with Commonwealth Bank (CBA)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-banking-with-commonwealth-bank-cba">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I went with CBA, and honestly, I wish I&rsquo;d done more prep work before leaving Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>The Smart Way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online from Taiwan/your home country</strong></li>
<li>Complete the application process remotely</li>
<li>When you arrive, walk into a branch and collect your card immediately</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Hard Way (My Way):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Applied after arriving</li>
<li>Still waiting for my card 😤</li>
<li>Having to rely on other payment methods in the meantime</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why CBA?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Largest network of ATMs</li>
<li>Good digital banking platform</li>
<li>Widely accepted everywhere</li>
<li>Helpful staff for newcomers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Essential Tip:</strong> For international students and working holiday visa holders, CBA has specific account packages. Do your research and apply early!</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resource:</strong> Check out this comprehensive guide: <a href="https://studycentralau.com/work-in-australia/commbank2022/">https://studycentralau.com/work-in-australia/commbank2022/</a></p>
<h3 id="-telecom-get-connected-instantly">📱 Telecom: Get Connected Instantly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-telecom-get-connected-instantly">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Airport Strategy:</strong> Hit up the telecom counters right when you land. Most major providers have booths at the airport with competitive deals for newcomers.</p>
<p><strong>My Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> 3 months for $70 AUD</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> 60GB</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Solid coverage in Melbourne metro area</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative Option:</strong> If you want to save a bit of money and don&rsquo;t mind ordering online:</p>
<p><strong>Special Offer:</strong> Use my referral code <strong>U9QM70R2UJ</strong> at <a href="https://konec.com.au">https://konec.com.au</a> for $10 off your first purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Airport vs. Online:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Airport:</strong> Instant activation, immediate help, but potentially more expensive</li>
<li><strong>Online:</strong> Better deals, referral discounts, but you&rsquo;ll need WiFi to set up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-the-game-plan">🎯 The Game Plan<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-the-game-plan">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Week 1 Priorities:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Secure accommodation</li>
<li>Apply for TFN online</li>
<li>Get telecom sorted (airport or online)</li>
<li>Visit CBA branch (if you pre-applied) or apply in-person</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Week 2-3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow up on TFN application</li>
<li>Set up direct debits and banking</li>
<li>Explore better phone plans if needed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-lessons-learned">💡 Lessons Learned<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-lessons-learned">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What I&rsquo;d Do Differently:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-apply for banking while still overseas</li>
<li>Research phone plans thoroughly before arriving</li>
<li>Have backup payment methods ready (just in case)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Worked Well:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the TFN application in early</li>
<li>Having all documents ready and organized</li>
<li>Using referral codes for savings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-final-thoughts">🚀 Final Thoughts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-final-thoughts">#</a></h3>
<p>These three essentials—TFN, banking, and telecom—are your foundation for life in Australia. Get them sorted quickly, and you&rsquo;ll have one less thing to stress about while you&rsquo;re adjusting to your new adventure Down Under.</p>
<p>The key is preparation and realistic expectations. Some things you can do from overseas, others you&rsquo;ll need to handle on arrival. Plan accordingly, and welcome to Australia! 🇦🇺</p>
