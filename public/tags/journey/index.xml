      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was late at night in yha hostel in Melbourne. Earlier, a group of us had been chatting around the bar table, sharing travel stories and laughing. Slowly, people drifted off to their rooms, until it was just me and a German guy still talking. The room grew quieter, but our conversation went deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me that when he observed the Korean guy who had been with us earlier, he noticed something: a kind of lack of confidence. Then he asked me if this was common among young people in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
