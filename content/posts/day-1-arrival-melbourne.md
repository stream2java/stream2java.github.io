## Application Process

Before going abroad, I had to go through several steps to get everything ready:

### Check Eligibility
Make sure you meet all the requirements.

### Fill Out Forms & Pay Fees
Be careful when filling out forms—don't just guess.

If you're unsure about a question, check it properly.

Honestly, I got a bit tired of the yes/no questions and just answered randomly.

### Medical Checkup
Complete the required health examination.

### Wait for Notification
Eventually, I received the S56 request, which confirmed my next steps.

## Preparing for the Trip

Once I confirmed I was going, I had to plan the practical side of things:

### Book Flights
I chose a budget airline, Scoot, with a stopover in Singapore.

Initially, I spotted a 16:30 flight for 8,000 TWD but missed it.

I ended up booking a 23:40 flight for the same price.

Extra baggage cost 2,500 TWD.

I thought I packed lightly, but my clothes and miscellaneous items totaled 21 kg—almost overweight.

If you have more luggage, consider a traditional airline with 2 × 20 kg allowance.

### Packing Tips
For long-haul flights, bring an eye mask and earplugs.

The plane turned on the lights at 01:30 for shopping, which was a bit annoying.

## Singapore Stopover Tips

### Lounge Access
If you have a JCB card, you can access the airport lounge for rest.

The food there is slightly cheaper than outside, but the maximum stay is 3 hours.

### Food Options
Airport food is generally expensive, but you can try some local specialties.

There are small 7-11 stores tucked away in less busy areas:
- Burrito: SGD 3.5
- Hainan Bao Kaya Toast Set: SGD 6.2

### Long Layovers
If your layover is long, you can exit the airport and explore nearby shopping malls.

This is also a good opportunity to exchange money, as the rates may be better than in Taiwan.

### Other Tips
- Go through security again for your connecting flight
- Consider whether you want to buy in-flight meals for the 9-hour flight
- Ask flight attendants for a Chinese version of the immigration card—it mentions tuberculosis

This whole process taught me a lot about planning, patience, and the small but important details when traveling internationally.
