## The English Barrier That Wasn't Really There

For years, English felt like my biggest obstacle. Back in Taiwan, the way we learned it never clicked—too much grammar and not enough real conversation. This year, I decided to change that. I bought ELSA Bold to fix my accent, watched American shows, and yes, even Peppa Pig (don't judge).

Then something magical happened in Melbourne: I found myself having basic conversations with no problem.

The funny part? A hostel friend from China started pulling me over to translate at the front desk. Me! The guy who used to struggle with English! It was hilarious and kind of validating.

## Big Words and Small Victories

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. I still hit walls sometimes. The other night, a German guy used the word "characteristic" to describe someone's personality traits. I was thinking, "Isn't that just... the point of the guy?" That word felt way too advanced for me—it's what I'd call a "big word."

But you know what? That's okay. I'm getting by. I'm communicating. And that's more than I ever thought I could do.

## Getting Life on Track

Week 2 has been about taking small steps:

**Shopping & Settling In**
- Started going to the market to buy groceries
- Bought stuff on Facebook Marketplace
- Learning to make coffee (because why not?)

**Job Hunting Begins**
- Walking into places to ask about jobs
- Sending out CVs online
- Slowly figuring out how this all works

**Building Connections**
- Arranging coffee talks with locals (great for both English and networking)
- Signed up for English classes at the library
- Planning to join weekend meetups and networking walks

## The Grind Continues

I've also started doing LeetCode every day. It's tough, but I'm hoping that every little bit of effort—whether it's improving my English, coding skills, or just figuring out life here—will add up to something better.

I keep telling myself: **keep going**.

Every small step counts. Every conversation, every CV sent, every line of code written. This is the journey, and I'm in it for the long haul.

Melbourne Week 2: survived, learned, and already dreaming of Week 3.

Can’t wait to see what’s next.
