It was late at night in yha hostel in Melbourne. Earlier, a group of us had been chatting around the bar table, sharing travel stories and laughing. Slowly, people drifted off to their rooms, until it was just me and a German guy still talking. The room grew quieter, but our conversation went deeper.

He told me that when he observed the Korean guy who had been with us earlier, he noticed something: a kind of lack of confidence. Then he asked me if this was common among young people in Asia.

He quickly clarified, "This isn't a judgment—it's just a characteristic." His impression was that young Asians often seem to lack confidence.

I thought about it, and honestly, it felt true. But I also felt it's not just about individuals—it's about the environment and the system we grow up in.

In Germany, kids finish school at three in the afternoon. Whether you want to continue studying is more flexible, and higher education is often tied to work—half of it can be practical training. Even as a basic worker, you can still live a decent life. And taking a gap year? Society is pretty open about it.

In Taiwan, it's a different story:

The minimum wage is around 1,500 AUD, but the cost of living isn't cheap.

School life is packed from early morning classes to evening study sessions, plus cram schools in between.

Once you enter the workforce, overtime is just part of life, and the so-called labor laws often don't really protect you.

In that kind of environment, many people can only just get by. It's hard to "dream big," let alone feel truly confident. Compared to Germany, where the system gives people more security and freedom, it's easy to see why confidence develops differently.

But then I told him something else: maybe traveling itself is one way to break out of that cycle.

That Korean guy—maybe his journey is about finding confidence again. And for me, it definitely is.

When we step outside of our familiar world, we finally get the chance to reimagine ourselves and learn to trust in who we are.

Dream big, stay strong.

Maybe that's what the journey is really about.
