## The Big Three: What You Need to Get Sorted ASAP

Moving to Australia? Here are the three essential services you'll need to set up as soon as you arrive. Trust me, these will make your life so much easier from day one.

### 🏛️ Tax File Number (TFN)

**The Reality Check:** Everyone says "you can only apply after arriving in Australia," but here's the real deal—you can actually apply once you have your accommodation sorted.

**What You Need:**
- Confirmed address in Australia
- Valid visa documents
- Form of identification

**Pro Tip:** Don't wait until you're physically in the country. As soon as you have a place to stay, get this application in. The sooner you apply, the sooner you can start earning without ridiculous tax deductions.

**Processing Time:** Usually 2-4 weeks, so the earlier the better.

### 🏦 Banking with Commonwealth Bank (CBA)

**My Experience:** I went with CBA, and honestly, I wish I'd done more prep work before leaving Taiwan.

**The Smart Way:**
1. **Apply online from Taiwan/your home country**
2. Complete the application process remotely  
3. When you arrive, walk into a branch and collect your card immediately

**The Hard Way (My Way):**
- Applied after arriving
- Still waiting for my card 😤
- Having to rely on other payment methods in the meantime

**Why CBA?** 
- Largest network of ATMs
- Good digital banking platform
- Widely accepted everywhere
- Helpful staff for newcomers

**Essential Tip:** For international students and working holiday visa holders, CBA has specific account packages. Do your research and apply early!

### 📱 Telecom: Get Connected Instantly

**Airport Strategy:** Hit up the telecom counters right when you land. Most major providers have booths at the airport with competitive deals for newcomers.

**My Setup:**
- **Plan:** 3 months for $70 AUD
- **Data:** 60GB
- **Network:** Solid coverage in Melbourne metro area

**Alternative Option:** If you want to save a bit of money and don't mind ordering online:

**Special Offer:** Use my referral code **U9QM70R2UJ** at https://konec.com.au for $10 off your first purchase.

**Airport vs. Online:**
- **Airport:** Instant activation, immediate help, but potentially more expensive
- **Online:** Better deals, referral discounts, but you'll need WiFi to set up

### 🎯 The Game Plan

**Week 1 Priorities:**
1. Secure accommodation
2. Apply for TFN online
3. Get telecom sorted (airport or online)
4. Visit CBA branch (if you pre-applied) or apply in-person

**Week 2-3:**
- Follow up on TFN application
- Set up direct debits and banking
- Explore better phone plans if needed

### 💡 Lessons Learned

**What I'd Do Differently:**
- Pre-apply for banking while still overseas
- Research phone plans thoroughly before arriving
- Have backup payment methods ready (just in case)

**What Worked Well:**
- Getting the TFN application in early
- Having all documents ready and organized
- Using referral codes for savings

### 🚀 Final Thoughts

These three essentials—TFN, banking, and telecom—are your foundation for life in Australia. Get them sorted quickly, and you'll have one less thing to stress about while you're adjusting to your new adventure Down Under.

The key is preparation and realistic expectations. Some things you can do from overseas, others you'll need to handle on arrival. Plan accordingly, and welcome to Australia! 🇦🇺
